                  <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
                  <hr>
                  <p>3 months after writing my first Hello World program on september 8th 2016 (while working in the marketing <br>
                  department) I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better version of the outdated <br>
                  laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>

                  <p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we are on the to mine. My newbie self was now
                  in charge <br> of hosting hundreds of thousand of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>

                  <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

              <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart <br>
              piece by piece. I break the code where i need to figure out why things <br> work
              the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.
